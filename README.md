# Python_W3Schools
Hey there! The purpose of this repository is to store all the practices from the Python course at https://my-learning.w3schools.com/. Just a chill and casual explanation for you.
I want to document my entire learning process of Python, making full use of all the tools that GitHub has to offer.
