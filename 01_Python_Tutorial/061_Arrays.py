# Note: Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but Python Lists can be used instead.

# Arrays
# Note: This page shows you how to use LISTS as ARRAYS, however, to work with arrays in Python you will have to import a library, like the NumPy library.

# Arrays are used to store multiple values in one single variable:

# ExampleGet your own Python Server
# Create an array containing car names:

cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
