# Python - Update Tuples
# Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that you cannot change, add, or remove items once the tuple is created.

# But there are some workarounds.

# Change Tuple Values
# Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.

# But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Example
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Convert the tuple into a list to be able to change it:

x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(x)
y[1] = "kiwi"
x = tuple(y)

print(x)

# Add Items
# Since tuples are immutable, they do not have a built-in append() method, but there are other ways to add items to a tuple.

# 1. Convert into a list: Just like the workaround for changing a tuple, you can convert it into a list, add your item(s), and convert it back into a tuple.
# ---------------------------------------
# Example
# ---------------------------------------
# Convert the tuple into a list, add "orange", and convert it back into a tuple:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(thistuple)
y.append("orange")
thistuple = tuple(y)

# 2. Add tuple to a tuple. You are allowed to add tuples to tuples, so if you want to add one item, (or many), create a new tuple with the item(s), and add it to the existing tuple:
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Example
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Create a new tuple with the value "orange", and add that tuple:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = ("orange",)
thistuple += y

print(thistuple)

# Note: When creating a tuple with only one item, remember to include a comma after the item, otherwise it will not be identified as a tuple.
# Remove Items
# Note: You cannot remove items in a tuple.

# Tuples are unchangeable, so you cannot remove items from it, but you can use the same workaround as we used for changing and adding tuple items:
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Example
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Convert the tuple into a list, remove "apple", and convert it back into a tuple:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(thistuple)
y.remove("apple")
thistuple = tuple(y)
