# Python - Update Tuples
# Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that you cannot change, add, or remove items once the tuple is created.

# But there are some workarounds.

# Change Tuple Values
# Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.

# But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Example
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Convert the tuple into a list to be able to change it:

x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(x)
y[1] = "kiwi"
x = tuple(y)

print(x)
