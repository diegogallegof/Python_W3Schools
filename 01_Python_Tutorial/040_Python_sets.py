# Set
# Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

# Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

# A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.

# * Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.

# Sets are written with curly brackets.
