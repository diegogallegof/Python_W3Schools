# Python Classes/Objects
# Python is an object oriented programming language.

# Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

# A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

# Create a Class
# To create a class, use the keyword class:
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Example
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:

class MyClass:
  ddd
  x = 5

#   Create Object
# Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:

# Example
# Create an object named p1, and print the value of x:

p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x)
