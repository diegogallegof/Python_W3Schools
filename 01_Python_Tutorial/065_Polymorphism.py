# Python Polymorphism
# The word "polymorphism" means "many forms", and in programming it refers to 
# methods/functions/operators with the same name that can be executed on many objects or classes.

# Function Polymorphism
# An example of a Python function that can be used on different objects is the len() function.

# String
# For strings len() returns the number of characters:
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Example
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
x = "Hello World!"

print(len(x))
