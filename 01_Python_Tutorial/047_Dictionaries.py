# Dictionary
# Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.

# A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

# As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.

# Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Example
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Create and print a dictionary:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)

# Dictionary Items
# Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and does not allow duplicates.

# Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.
# ------------------------------------------
# Example
# ------------------------------------------
# Print the "brand" value of the dictionary:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict["brand"])

# Ordered or Unordered?
# As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.

# When we say that dictionaries are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

# Unordered means that the items does not have a defined order, you cannot refer to an item by using an index.

# Changeable
# Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.

# Duplicates Not Allowed
# Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key:
# --------------------------------
# Example
# --------------------------------
# Duplicate values will overwrite existing values:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964,
  "year": 2020
}
print(thisdict)
