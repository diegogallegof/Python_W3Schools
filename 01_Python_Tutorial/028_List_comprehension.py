# List Comprehension
# List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.

# Example:

# Based on a list of fruits, you want a new list, containing only the fruits with the letter "a" in the name.

# Without list comprehension you will have to write a for statement with a conditional test inside:
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Example
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = []

for x in fruits:
  if "a" in x:
    newlist.append(x)

print(newlist)

# With list comprehension you can do all that with only one line of code:
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Example
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]

newlist = [x for x in fruits if "a" in x]

print(newlist)

# The Syntax
# newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]
# The return value is a new list, leaving the old list unchanged.

# Condition
# The condition is like a filter that only accepts the items that valuate to True.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Example
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Only accept items that are not "apple":

newlist = [x for x in fruits if x != "apple"]
