# Python Modules
# What is a Module?
# Consider a module to be the same as a code library.

# A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.

# Create a Module
# To create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension .py:

# Example
# Save this code in a file named mymodule.py

def greeting(name):
  print("Hello, " + name)
